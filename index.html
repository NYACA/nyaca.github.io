        <h3>Who Are We?</h3>

	<p>Anyone in the NYC metro area interested in computational astrophysics.</p>

	<p>This page attempts to loosely organize the different
	  computational astrophysics groups in the greater NYC area.</p>

	<h3>Goals</h3>
	<p>Our goals are:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Letting each other know what sort of research areas we
	      are active in and build new collaborations</li>
	    
	    <li>Talking about the codes and techniques we have
	      available (both within your group and freely available
	      to the community)</li>

	    <li>Discuss ways to train our students better (maybe a
	      collaborative summer school?)</li>

	    <li>Geting our students talking and give them an
	      opportunity to present their work at the various
	      institutions and collaborate with one another</li>

	    <li>Working toward building a multi-institution NY-area
	      network to put us in a better position to go after big
	      grants (NSF Physics Frontiers, NNSA PSAAP, DOE SciDAC, ...)</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	  
	<h3>Meetings</h3>
	<p>We plan on having a first meeting on Friday, April 24, 2015,
	  mainly to get to know one-another.  We will meet on the campus of
	  <a href="http://www.farmingdale.edu/">Farmingdale State
	    College</a> in Lupton Hall T101.  If you are coming from
	    the City, the Farmingdale LIRR station is nearby and a
	    shuttle can take you to campus (details on this to come).

	<p>Please register (below) so we have a head-count.  Note:
	  because of space limitations, we will only accept the first
	  30 people to sign up.</p>

	<p>Proposed Agenda:
	  <ul>
	    <li>10:10am: LIRR train arrives at Farmingdale (departs Penn Station at 9:14am)</li>
	    <li>10:30am &ndash; 12:30pm: 20 minute intros from each group (part I)</li>
	    <li>12:30pm &ndash; 1:30pm: pizza lunch + informal discussion</li>
	    <li>1:30pm &ndash; 2:30pm: 20 minute intros from each group (part II)</li>
	    <li>2:30pm &ndash; 4:15pm: group discussions on training, collaborations, etc.</li>
	    <li>4:15pm: wrap up, head to train station for 4:38pm LIRR back to Penn Station</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<p>Meeting organizers:<br>
	  Jeff Oishi (Farmingdale): oishij AT farmingdale.edu<br>
	  Michael Zingale (Stony Brook): michael.zingale AT stonybrook.edu
