        <h3>Who Are We?</h3>

	<p>Anyone in the NYC metro area interested in computational astrophysics.</p>

	<p>This page attempts to loosely organize the different
	  computational astrophysics groups in the greater NYC area.</p>

	<h3>Goals</h3>
	<p>Our goals are:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Letting each other know what sort of research areas we
	      are active in and build new collaborations</li>
	    
	    <li>Talking about the codes and techniques we have
	      available (both within your group and freely available
	      to the community)</li>

	    <li>Discuss ways to train our students better (maybe a
	      collaborative summer school?)</li>

	    <li>Geting our students talking and give them an
	      opportunity to present their work at the various
	      institutions and collaborate with one another</li>

	    <li>Working toward building a multi-institution NY-area
	      network to put us in a better position to go after big
	      grants (NSF Physics Frontiers, NNSA PSAAP, DOE SciDAC, ...)</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	  
	<h3>Meetings</h3>
	<p>We plan on having a first meeting on Friday, April 24, 2015,
	  mainly to get to know one-another.  We will meet on the campus of
	  <a href="http://www.farmingdale.edu/">Farmingdale State
	    College</a> in Lupton Hall T101.  If you are coming from
	    the City, the Farmingdale LIRR station is nearby and a
	    shuttle can take you to campus (details on this to come).

	<p>Please register (below) so we have a head-count.  Note:
	  because of space limitations, we will only accept the first
	  30 people to sign up.</p>

	<p><h4>Agenda</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li>10:10am: LIRR train arrives at Farmingdale (departs Penn Station at 9:14am)<br>
	      Note: Jeff will be riding this same train, and he will lead everyone to the
	      meeting location (there's a short shuttle ride)</li>

	    <li>10:30am &ndash; 10:45am: Welcome and introductions</li>
	    <li>10:45am &ndash; 11:15am: Comp Astro @ Columbia</li>
	    <li>11:15am &ndash; 11:45am: Comp Astro @ Farmingdale</li>
	    <li>11:45am &ndash; 12:15pm: Comp Astro @ AMNH</li>	   
	    <li>12:15pm &ndash;  1:00pm: pizza lunch (we'll collect ~$5 from each participant)
	    <li>1:00pm &ndash; 1:30pm: Comp Astro @ Stony Brook</li>
	    <li>1:30pm &ndash; 2:00pm: Comp Astro @ CUNY</li>
	    <li>2:00pm &ndash; 2:30pm: Comp Astro @ LIU</li>
	    <li>2:30pm &ndash; 3:00pm: Comp Astro @ NYU</li>
	    <li>3:00pm &ndash; 4:15pm: open discussion</li>
	    <li>4:15pm: wrap up, head to train station for 4:38pm LIRR back to Penn Station</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<p><h4>Logistics</h4>
	  <ul>
	    <li><em>LIRR</em>: Jeff will be on the 9:14am train from Penn
	    Station. He'll be in the rear car on the train (closest
	    to the 8th Ave side of the station), if you'd like to meet
	    up. If you get in a different car, that's fine too. We'll
	    all meet on the middle of the platform at Farmingdale
	    station, where the historic brick station house is. From
	    there, we'll take shuttle vans to campus. You'll need $4
	    cash to ride (exact change NOT required).  They will be
	    nearly empty on a Friday, so we can probably all get in
	    one. He'll lead everyone to the room, so if you're riding
	    We'll take one of the scheduled vans back, if you're
	    taking the 4:38pm back to the city. If you need to leave
	    earlier, just let him know, and we'll get you to whatever
	      train you need.</li>

	    <li><em>Driving</em>: There are more directions in the map
	    below, but here is an overview. Enter the campus at the
	    main entrance on 110. Drive to the University Police
	    station (it's the first left once you enter campus). Go
	    in, and ask for a visitor parking pass. Tell them you're
	    with the NY Area Computational Astrophysics Group meeting,
	    and that you're visiting me (Jeff Oishi, in Physics). I
	    will be in touch with them ahead of time. They will issue
	    you a visitor parking pass, which is good in any student
	    parking space. Again, because we don't have many classes
	    on Friday, you should have no trouble finding parking near
	    Lupton Hall. The best place to park is marked on the map
	    linked below, along with an alternate parking lot. You'll
	    enter Lupton Hall through the side entrance marked
	    "Institute for Research and Technology Transfer". Lupton
	    T101 is the first door directly in front of you once you
	      enter. Jeff will put signs up.<br>
