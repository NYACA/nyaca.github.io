        <h3>Who Are We?</h3>

	<p>This page attempts to loosely organize the different
	  computational astrophysics groups in the greater NYC area.</p>

	<h3>Goals</h3>
	<p>Our goals are:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Letting each other know what sort of research areas we
	      are active in and build new collaborations</li>
	    
	    <li>Talking about the codes and techniques we have
	      available (both within your group and freely available
	      to the community)</li>

	    <li>Discuss ways to train our students better (maybe a
	      collaborative summer school?)</li>

	    <li>Geting our students talking and give them an
	      opportunity to present their work at the various
	      institutions and collaborate with one another</li>

	    <li>Working toward building a multi-institution NY-area
	      network to put us in a better position to go after big
	      grants (NSF Physics Frontiers, NNSA PSAAP, DOE SciDAC, ...)</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	  
	<h3>Meetings</h3>
	<p>We plan on having a first meeting on Friday, April 23, 2015,
	  mainly to get to know one-another.  Meeting details and sign-up
	  form will appear shortly</p>
