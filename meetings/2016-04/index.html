	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>The 2016 meeting of the New York Area Computational
          Astrophysics group will be at the American Museum of Natural
          History (AMNH) on Friday April 8th, 2016, in the Linder Theater.</p>


	<p>The meeting will have two themes this year: <em>Community and Collaboration</em>
	  and <em>Students of Computational Astrophysics</em>.  The morning will be largely
          unstructured, and focus on collaborations among the institutions in the area.  </p>

	<h3>Logistics</h3>

	<p>The meeting is held in the Linder Theater at the American Museum of Natural History.

	<p>If you are arriving by subway, you can take the B or C to
	81st St or the 1 to 79th. If you take the B or C, exit the
	station, and you will be on Central Park West. Do NOT go to
	the planetarium entrance on the North side. Walk downtown on
	Central Park West with the museum on your right hand
	side. Turn right on 77th st, and use the entrance halfway down
	the block. 

        <p>If you take the 1 train to 79th st, exit the
	station and walk east on 79th Street until you run into the
	museum at Columbus Ave. Turn downtown (right) on Columbus and
	walk to 77th. Make a left on 77th and the entrance will be
	midblock. The museum will not yet be open, but the guard will
	let you in and direct you to Linder. 

        <p>If you are driving, you
	may be able to park in the museum's lot (on 81st Street
	between Columbus and Central Park West), but you will need to
	walk all the way around the museum to the 77th street
	entrance.
	
	<p>We will order pizzas for the lunch break, and expect to
	collect a nominal fee ($5) to cover costs.  If it is nice out,
	we will eat outside at the terrace.  We are also exploring
	plans for coffee at the meeting.

	<h3>Topics for discussion</h3>

	There is a lot of time for open discussion.  We ask that you propose a topic you might
	want to lead a discussion of when you register.  If there are multiple suggestions of
	the same topic, we'll ask for people to lead the topic together.  Potential topics include:
	a summer school, collaborative teaching of computational astro courses across institutions,
	an area-wide seminar series (that is streamed to the different institutions), ...

	<h3>Student presentations</h3>
	
	The afternoon is dedicated to student presentations.  The talk schedule is now posted.
