	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>The 2016 meeting of the New York Area Computational
          Astrophysics group will be at the American Museum of Natural
          History (AMNH) on Friday April 8th, 2016, in the Linder Theater.</p>


	<p>The meeting will have two themes this year: <em>Community and Collaboration</em>
	  and <em>Students of Computational Astrophysics</em>.  The morning will be largely
          unstructured, and focus on collaborations among the institutions in the area.  </p>

	<h3>Logistics</h3>

	The meeting is held in the Linder Theater at the museum.
	Directions to get there from the subway stop will be posted
	shortly.
	
	We will order pizzas for the lunch break, and expect to
	collect a nominal fee ($5) to cover costs.  If it is nice out,
	we will eat outside at the terrace.  We are also exploring
	plans for coffee at the meeting.

	<h3>Topics for discussion</h3>

	There is a lot of time for open discussion.  We ask that you propose a topic you might
	want to lead a discussion of when you register.  If there are multiple suggestions of
	the same topic, we'll ask for people to lead the topic together.  Potential topics include:
	a summer school, collaborative teaching of computational astro courses across institutions,
	an area-wide seminar series (that is streamed to the different institutions), ...

	<h3>Student presentations</h3>
	
	The afternoon is dedicated to student presentations.  The talk schedule is now posted.

	<h3>Registration</h3>
