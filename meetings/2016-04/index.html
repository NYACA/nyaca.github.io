	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>The 2016 meeting of the New York Area Computational
          Astrophysics group will be at the American Museum of Natural
          History (AMNH) on Friday April 8th, 2016.</p>


	<p>The meeting will have two themes this year: <em>Community and Collaboration</em>
	  and <em>Students of Computational Astrophysics</em>.  The morning will be largely
          unstructured, and focus on collaborations among the institutions in the area.  </p>

	  
	<h3>Tentative Agenda</h3>

	<ul>
	  <li>9:30am &mdash; Arrivals and informal introductions</li>
	  <li>10:00am &mdash;Meeting kick-off introduction</li>
	  <li>10:30am &mdash; How the new <em>Simons Center for Computational Astrophysics</em> will
              foster collaboration (David Spergel) + open discussion</li>
	  <li>11:30am &mdash; Open discussion, based on community topics submitted at registration.</li>
	  <li>12:30pm to 1:30pm &mdash; lunch break</li>
	  <li>1:30pm to 4:30pm &mdash; student presentations
	  (sign up at registration &ndash; likely 20 min per talk)</li>
	  <li>4:30pm &mdash; closing remarks and plans for the future</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Topics for discussion</h3>

	There is a lot of time for open discussion.  We ask that you propose a topic you might
	want to lead a discussion of when you register.  If there are multiple suggestions of
	the same topic, we'll ask for people to lead the topic together.  Potential topics include:
	a summer school, collaborative teaching of computational astro courses across institutions,
	an area-wide seminar series (that is streamed to the different institutions), ...

	<h3>Student presentations</h3>
	
	The afternoon is dedicated to student presentations.  We imagine 9 talks.  If we get
	too many requests for talks, then we will select 9 from the submissions, balancing the
	talks across area institutions.

	<h3>Registration</h3>
